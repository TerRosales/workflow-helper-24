          is meant to help our associates need less dependance from our team
          leads. In general team leads are in charge of low level maintenance
          within their designated departments, as the shift goes they are being
          prompt to take care of minor troubleshooting and maintenance tasks to
          keep their lines running all shift, according to my observations and
          feedback from the team leads, 70% of these issues can be fixed by
          anyone on the floor but what we lack is the tool that can allow us
          machinist to perform these fixes by following a step by step guide on
          each issue that they encounter.
