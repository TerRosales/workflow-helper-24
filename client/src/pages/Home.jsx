          is meant to help our associates need less dependence from our team
          leads. In general, team leads are in charge of low-level maintenance
          within their designated departments. As the shift goes, they are being
          prompted to take care of minor troubleshooting and maintenance tasks
          to keep their lines running all shift. According to my observations
          and feedback from the team leads, 70% of these issues can be fixed by
          anyone on the floor, but what we lack is the tool that can allow us
          machinists to perform these fixes by following a step-by-step guide on
          each issue that they encounter.
