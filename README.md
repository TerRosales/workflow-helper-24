WORKFLOW HELPER

Hello, I'm Terrence Rosales, Ft wayne IN

This helper will act as an manual for workflow in my current work. We work with CNC machines and we adjust certain specs according to our product
quality readings,this is not a difficult job but there are plenty of machine troubleshooting involved. I'd like the ease everyone work stress levels
by providing a way to eliminate the calculations, guess-timating adjustments and down time from waiting for Team Leads/ maintenance team.

My Aim for this year is not to get a job but to gain a more depth understanding about programming, I started last July 18 on a 3 month cohort,
ever since after that I have been doing the self-taught route. I am here to prove my own self that, I have been doing good and improving,
regardless of all the negative thoughts and imposter syndrome I am experiencing. I plan to keep learning because programming is such a innovative
way to improve one self upon. Thank you everyone
